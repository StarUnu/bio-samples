# A COMPARISON OF KAMERIS AND CASTOR-KRFE
Author: MSc. Vicente Machaca Arceda

Online version for testing Kameris algorithm and see the CGR: http://134.209.44.160/viral/viral.html

Kameris and Castor-KRFE are methods based on k-mer frequencies for viral subtypying classification. Kameris was proposed by Solis-Reyes et al. (2018), they compute the k-mer frequencies using a Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) mean while Castor-KRFE,
proposed by Lebatteux, Remita, and Diallo (2019), compute the k-mer frequencies from the whole training datasets.

# Files and folders descriptión:
- chaos_game.- Compute the CGR of a viral genome. The implementation is in Javascript.
- sample_genomes.- Some genome samples of HIV-1 and Polyomavirus.
- results.- Here, there are CSVs and images computed with the comparison of Kameris and Castor-KRFE.
- feature_extractor.py.- Implementation of Castor-KRFE [1].
- mykameris.py.- Implementation of Kameris [2]. The implementation is in cgr() function.
- compare.py.- This script divides the dataset and train with Kameris and Castor-KRFE. It generates CSVs files.
- graphics.py.- This script takes the CSVs generated by compare.py and plot the results.
- train.py.- This script train the datasets with all samples and the models.
- test.py.- This script evaluate a sample genome and reurn its virus subtype.

# Training
First download the datasets from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17xcPSTebwBriZCxhTA26fHF098AY0H7k?usp=sharing.

For training you must run the script: 

- compare.py  $path_to_dataset  $virus_type  $dimentionality_reduction 

For example in my case is:

- compare.py "/home/vicente/projects/BIOINFORMATICS/datasets/VIRAL/"  HIV  1

If we need a comparison without dimentionality reduction:

- compare.py "/home/vicente/projects/BIOINFORMATICS/datasets/VIRAL/"  HIV  0

The $virus_type could be:
- POL
- HIV
- DENGE

The $dimentionality_reduction could be:
- 0
- 1

The compare.py script will generate CSVs files named for example as: "HIVGRPCG_dr=0_nfeatures.csv" this file correspond to HIVGRPCG dataset without dimentionality reduction. Also, the file "POLSPELT_dr=1_nfeatures" correspond to the POLSPELT dataset with dimentionality reduction. 

Also, you could run train.py in order to train the datasets with all samples, the models are saved in /models/ directory.
- train.py $path_to_dataset $virus_type $dimentionality_reduction

# Testing

For testing you must run the script test.py as follows:

- test.py  $fasta_file  $virus_type

$fasta_fil is the full path to a sequence in Fasta format. The $virus_type could be:
- POLSPEVP1, POLSPEVP2, POLSPEVP3, POLSPEST, POLSPELT
- HIVGRPCG, HIVSUBCG, HIVSUBPOL
