# A COMPARISON OF KAMERIS AND CASTOR-KRFE

Kameris and Castor-KRFE are methods based on k-mer frequencies for viral subtypying classification. Kameris was proposed by Solis-Reyes et al. (2018), they compute the k-mer frequencies using a Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) mean while Castor-KRFE,
proposed by Lebatteux, Remita, and Diallo (2019), compute the k-mer frequencies from the whole training datasets.
