# A COMPARISON OF KAMERIS AND CASTOR-KRFE
Author: MSC. Vicente Machaca Arceda

Kameris and Castor-KRFE are methods based on k-mer frequencies for viral subtypying classification. Kameris was proposed by Solis-Reyes et al. (2018), they compute the k-mer frequencies using a Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) mean while Castor-KRFE,
proposed by Lebatteux, Remita, and Diallo (2019), compute the k-mer frequencies from the whole training datasets.

# Files and folders descripción:
- chaos_game.- Compute the CGR of a viral genome. The implementation is in Javascript.
- hiv1-genomes.- Some genome samples of HIV-1.
- results.- Here, there are CSVs and images computed with the comparison of Kameris and Castor-KRFE.
- feature_extractor.py.- Implementation of Castor-KRFE [1].
- mykameris.py.- Implementation of Kameris [2]. The implementation is in cgr() function.
- compare.py.- This script divides the dataset and train with Kameris and Castor-KRFE. It generates CSVs files.
- graphics.py.- This script takes the CSVs generated by compare.py and plot the results.

# Requeriments
- Python==3.6.3 
- numpy==1.11.0
- matplotlib==3.0.3
- kameris==1.2.3 (only used for the comparison of kameris's real implementation and Kameris's own implementation)
- kameris_formats==1.0.6 (only used for the comparison of kameris's real implementation and Kameris's own implementation)
- iteration_utilities==0.10.1
- pandas==0.24.2
- tqdm==4.43.0
- seaborn==0.9.1
- Bio==0.1.0
- scikit_learn==0.22.2.post1

# Training
First download the datasets from: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17xcPSTebwBriZCxhTA26fHF098AY0H7k?usp=sharing  .

For training you must run the script: 

compare.py $path_to_dataset $virus_type $dimentionality_reduction 

For example in my case is:

compare.py "/home/vicente/projects/BIOINFORMATICS/datasets/VIRAL/" HIV 1

If we need a comparison without dimentionality reduction:

compare.py "/home/vicente/projects/BIOINFORMATICS/datasets/VIRAL/" HIV 0

The virus types could be:
- POL
- HIV
- DENGE
